            Hello! I'm Chaitu, a passionate software developer specializing in
            creating dynamic and responsive web applications. With a background
            in Computer Science and Engineering, I have hands-on experience in
            modern technologies like React, Angular, Java, and Spring Boot.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey in the tech world has been driven by a love for problem-solving
            and a desire to create impactful solutions. I enjoy working on projects that
            challenge me and push the boundaries of what's possible. Whether it's
            developing a complex web app or exploring quantum computing, I'm always
            eager to learn and grow.

            When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring new tech trends, working
            on personal projects, or spending time with family and friends. Feel free
            to get in touch to discuss potential collaborations or just to connect!
